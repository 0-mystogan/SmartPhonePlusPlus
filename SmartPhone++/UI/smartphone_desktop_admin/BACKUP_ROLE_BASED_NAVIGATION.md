# Role-Based Navigation Implementation Backup

## Overview
This document describes the role-based navigation implementation that routes users to different master screens based on their roles.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. AuthProvider (Modified)
- **File**: `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`
- **Changes**: Converted from simple static class to ChangeNotifier with authentication logic
- **Features**: 
  - User authentication with API
  - Role checking methods (`hasRole`, `isTechnician`, `isAdministrator`)
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Logout functionality

### 2. DashboardScreen (Modified)
- **File**: `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`
- **Changes**: Now acts as a router based on user role
- **Logic**: 
  - Technician → DashboardScreenTechnician
  - Administrator → DashboardScreenAdmin
  - Default → DashboardScreenTechnician

### 3. DashboardScreenAdmin (New)
- **File**: `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_admin.dart`
- **Purpose**: Admin dashboard using regular master screen
- **Features**: Same statistics as technician but with admin branding

### 4. LoginPage (Modified)
- **File**: `lib/main.dart` (LoginPage class)
- **Changes**: Updated to use AuthProvider for authentication
- **Features**: Loading states, proper error handling, role-based routing

### 5. Master Screens (Modified)
- **Files**: 
  - `lib/layouts/master_screen.dart`
  - `lib/layouts/master_screen_technician.dart`
- **Changes**: Added logout functionality that clears auth state

## How It Works

1. **Login**: User enters credentials → AuthProvider authenticates with API
2. **Role Detection**: AuthProvider checks user roles from API response
3. **Routing**: DashboardScreen routes to appropriate dashboard based on role
4. **Navigation**: Each role gets their specific master screen with relevant navigation

## API Endpoint Required

The implementation expects a `/Users/me` endpoint that returns user data including roles:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "username": "technician1",
  "roles": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Technician",
      "description": "Technician role",
      "isActive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to Revert

If you need to revert to the previous implementation:

1. **Restore AuthProvider**:
   ```dart
   class AuthProvider {
     static String? username;
     static String? password;
   }
   ```

2. **Restore LoginPage**:
   ```dart
   ElevatedButton(
     onPressed: () async {
       AuthProvider.username = usernameController.text;
       AuthProvider.password = passwordController.text;
       // ... rest of original login logic
     },
   )
   ```

3. **Restore DashboardScreen**:
   ```dart
   class DashboardScreen extends StatefulWidget {
     // ... original implementation
   }
   ```

4. **Remove new files**:
   - Delete `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_admin.dart`
   - Remove AuthProvider from main.dart providers

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Technician Login**: Use a user with "Technician" role → Should see technician master screen
2. **Admin Login**: Use a user with "Administrator" role → Should see admin master screen
3. **Logout**: Should clear auth state and return to login

## Benefits

- ✅ **Role-based access**: Different interfaces for different roles
- ✅ **Secure authentication**: Proper API-based authentication
- ✅ **Clean separation**: Each role has their own dashboard and navigation
- ✅ **Easy to extend**: Add new roles by creating new dashboard screens
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns

## Notes

- The implementation assumes the API returns user roles in the authentication response
- If the API structure is different, adjust the AuthProvider accordingly
- The technician dashboard uses `master_screen_technician.dart` as requested
- The admin dashboard uses the regular `master_screen.dart`
